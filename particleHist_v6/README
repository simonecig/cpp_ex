runDump <command> [argument] ...
COMMANDS
    sim {n}
        Simulate {n} events
    input {filename.txt}
        Read events from {filename.txt}
    dump
        Prints the events on the standard output

********************
runMass <command> [argument]
COMMANDS
    sim {n}
        Simulate {n} events
    input {filename.txt}
        Read events from {filename.txt}
    mass 
        Calculate mean masses and rms for both hypotesis and create a histogram.
        Unless the command <plot> is used to specify a file name, the 
        histogram is stored in a root file called hist.root. 
        If the file already exists, no file is created.
    plot {fname.root}
        Specify the name for the root file 
    mranges {fname.txt}
        Import accepted mass ranges from the file {fname.txt}
    nBins {n}
        Draw the histogram with {n} bins. 
        {n} must be a postive integer.
        Default value is 100.

runTime <command> [argument] ...
COMMANDS
    sim {n}
        Simulate {n} events
    input {filename.txt}
        Read events from {filename.txt}
    time {fname.root}
        Calculate mean decaying time and rms for both hypotesis and create a histogram.
        Unless the command <plot> is used to specify a file name, the 
        histogram is stored in a root file called hist.root. 
        If the file already exists, no file is created.
    plot {fname.root}
        Specify the name for the root file 
    tranges {fname.txt}
        Import accepted time ranges and fit parameters from the file {fname.txt}. 
    nBins {n}
        Draw the histogram with {n} bins. 
        {n} must be a postive integer.
        Default value is 100.

********************
runAll <command> [argument] ...
COMMANDS
    sim {n}
        Simulate {n} events
    input {filename.txt}
        Read events from {filename.txt}
    dump
        Prints the events on the standard output
    time {fname.root}
        Calculate mean decaying time and rms for both hypotesis and create a histogram.
        Unless the command <plot> is used to specify a file name, the

    mranges {fname.txt}
        Import accepted mass ranges from the file {fname.txt}
    plot {fname.root}
        Specify the name for the root file (<time> and <mass> both)
    nBins {n}
        Draw the histogram with {n} bins. 
        {n} must be a postive integer.
        Default value is 100.
